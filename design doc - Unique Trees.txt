========= Unique trees =====



TO DO 
- change growButton sprites (grey, root)
- make a greyed-out sprite for all types of roots? (Make sure roots match branches in almost all ways!)
- Unlock each tree after completing the previous one for the first time. (Before that, stump isn't even there? Or it has no bud?
- Title panel changes upon completing ALL TREES (except #0). Can minimize panel to find a secret extra (4)-size tree!
   (Does 4-size tree mechanically work okay? It should!)
- Panel background variety, allowing sand to match up.
- multiple branches (some with a bit of green?, randomly select 1
- some trees not updating!

- track if tree has dupe, no petals if so?
- sound? growBranch, cutBranch, treeFinished (newUnlock?),
