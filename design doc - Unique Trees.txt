========= Unique trees =====



TO DO 
- make a greyed-out sprite for all types of roots? (Make sure roots match branches in almost all ways!)
- multiple branches (some with a bit of green?, randomly select 1       Flowers on branch!!!
- some trees not updating!

- track if tree has dupe, no petals if so?
- sound? growBranch, cutBranch, treeFinished (newUnlock?), 

- numbers should show current number?   3 / (5) ?
- blue/grey circle around the copied tree? (and change text color?)
